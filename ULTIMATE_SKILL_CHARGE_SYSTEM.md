# Ultimate Skill Charge System

## ✅ **MAJOR FEATURE IMPLEMENTED**

### **Ultimate Skill Charge-Up Mechanics** ✅
Ultimate skills now require a 3-turn charge period before they can be used, plus maintain the existing 3-turn cooldown after use.

#### **Charge System Overview:**
```
Turn 1: Ultimate skill starts charging (0/3)
Turn 2: Ultimate skill charging (1/3)  
Turn 3: Ultimate skill charging (2/3)
Turn 4: Ultimate skill ready! (3/3) ✅ Can use
Turn 5: Ultimate used → Cooldown starts (3 turns) + Charge resets (0/3)
Turn 6: On cooldown (2 turns remaining)
Turn 7: On cooldown (1 turn remaining)  
Turn 8: Cooldown finished, charging begins again (0/3)
```

#### **Strategic Impact:**
- **No instant ultimates** - Players must build up to powerful attacks
- **Tactical planning** - Decide when to use charged ultimates
- **Balanced combat** - Prevents ultimate spam and overpowered openings
- **Turn management** - Players must survive while charging ultimates

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Charge Tracking System:**
```python
# Initialize charges for all ultimate skills
self.skill_charges = BattleSkillIntegration.initialize_skill_charges(player.skills)

# Update charges each turn
self.skill_charges = BattleSkillIntegration.update_skill_charges(
    self.skill_charges, player.skills
)

# Check if ultimate is ready
charge_check = await BattleSkillIntegration.is_ultimate_skill_ready(
    skill_id, player_id, self.skill_charges, self.skill_cooldowns
)
```

### **Charge Mechanics:**
```python
def get_ultimate_skill_charge_time(skill_type_value: str) -> int:
    """Ultimate skills need 3 turns to charge"""
    if skill_type_value == "Ultimate":
        return 3
    return 0  # No charge time for Basic and QTE skills

def update_skill_charges(skill_charges: dict, player_skills: dict) -> dict:
    """Increment charge for ultimate skills each turn"""
    for skill_id in player_skills.keys():
        current_charge = skill_charges.get(skill_id, 0)
        if current_charge < 3:  # Max charge is 3
            skill_charges[skill_id] = current_charge + 1
    return skill_charges
```

### **Usage Validation:**
```python
async def is_ultimate_skill_ready(skill_id, player_id, skill_charges, skill_cooldowns):
    """Check if ultimate skill can be used"""
    # Check cooldown first
    if skill_cooldowns.get(skill_id, 0) > 0:
        return {"ready": False, "reason": f"On cooldown ({cooldowns[skill_id]} turns)"}
    
    # Check charge
    current_charge = skill_charges.get(skill_id, 0)
    if current_charge < 3:
        return {"ready": False, "reason": f"Charging ({current_charge}/3 turns)"}
    
    return {"ready": True, "reason": "Ready to use"}
```
