# Skill Points vs Stat Points Separation Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to properly separate skill points from stat points in the Discord bot.

## System Overview

### Stat Points (ðŸ“Š)
- **Purpose**: Used exclusively for upgrading base stats (Attack, Defense, Health, MP, Precision)
- **Earned**: 10 stat points per level up
- **Used by**: `sl stats` command and `sl su` (stat upgrade) command
- **Storage**: `player.statPoints` attribute

### Skill Points (âœ¥)
- **Purpose**: Used exclusively for skill tree progression and learning skills
- **Earned**: 5 skill points per level up
- **Used by**: Skill tree system, skill learning, skill upgrades
- **Storage**: `player.skillPoints` attribute

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Stats Command Display (`commands/Stat.py`)
**Before**: Showed skill points in stats display
```python
description=f"Level: **{player.level}**\n**âœ¥** Skill Points: **{player.skillPoints}**"
```

**After**: Now shows stat points correctly
```python
description=f"Level: **{player.level}**\n**ðŸ“Š** Stat Points: **{player.statPoints}**"
```

### 2. Fixed Stat Points Calculation
**Before**: Stat upgrade system calculated 5 stat points per level
```python
player.statPoints = player.level * 5  # 5 stat points per level
```

**After**: Now correctly calculates 10 stat points per level
```python
player.statPoints = player.level * 10  # 10 stat points per level
```

### 3. Fixed Level Up Rewards (`structure/player.py`)
**Before**: Inconsistent rewards with bonus system
```python
stat_points_gained = 5  # 5 stat points per level
skill_points_gained = 2  # 2 skill points per level
# Bonus skill points every 10 levels
if self.level % 10 == 0:
    skill_points_gained += 5
```

**After**: Consistent rewards as specified
```python
stat_points_gained = 10  # 10 stat points per level
skill_points_gained = 5  # 5 skill points per level
```

### 4. Fixed Stat Reset System
**Before**: Stat reset was incorrectly giving skill points
```python
fresh_player.skillPoints = fresh_player.level * 10
```

**After**: Stat reset now correctly gives stat points
```python
fresh_player.statPoints = fresh_player.level * 10
```

### 5. Updated Error Messages and Descriptions
- Changed "skill points" to "stat points" in stat-related error messages
- Updated help text to show correct point amounts (+10 ðŸ“Š per level)
- Fixed stat reset confirmation dialog to show stat points instead of skill points

## Verification

### Systems Using Stat Points âœ…
- `sl stats` command - Shows stat points available
- `sl su` (stat upgrade) command - Uses stat points to upgrade stats
- Stat reset system - Refunds stat points when resetting stats

### Systems Using Skill Points âœ…
- Skill tree system (`structure/skill_tree_system.py`) - Uses skill points for unlocking/upgrading skills
- Skill learning system - Uses skill points for learning new skills
- Skill reset system (`commands/skill_reset.py`) - Refunds skill points when resetting skills

## Player Attributes

### Current Implementation
```python
# In structure/player.py
self.statPoints = self.calculate_stat_points()  # 10 per level
self.skillPoints = self.calculate_skill_points()  # 5 per level

def calculate_stat_points(self):
    return self.level * 10

def calculate_skill_points(self):
    return self.level * 5
```

### Level Up Rewards
```python
# On each level up:
stat_points_gained = 10  # For stat upgrades
skill_points_gained = 5  # For skill tree progression
```

## Commands Summary

| Command | Points Used | Purpose |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `sl stats` | Shows stat points | View current stats and available stat points |
| `sl su` | Uses stat points | Upgrade base stats (attack, defense, etc.) |
| `sl skilltree` | Uses skill points | Access skill tree progression |
| `sl skillreset` | Refunds skill points | Reset skill tree progression |
| `sl statreset` | Refunds stat points | Reset base stats to default |

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Level Up Test**: Verify players get 10 stat points and 5 skill points per level
2. **Stats Display Test**: Check `sl stats` shows stat points, not skill points
3. **Stat Upgrade Test**: Verify `sl su` uses stat points correctly
4. **Skill Tree Test**: Verify skill tree uses skill points correctly
5. **Reset Tests**: Verify both reset systems use correct point types

## No Cross-Contamination

The systems are now completely separated:
- Stat-related functions only reference `statPoints`
- Skill-related functions only reference `skillPoints`
- No mixing of point types between systems

This ensures that skill points are exclusively for skill tree progression and stat points are exclusively for base stat upgrades, as requested.
