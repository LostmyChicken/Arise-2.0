## 🚀 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Key Changes Made**:

#### **1. Message Persistence**
```python
# Store message reference for updates
self.story_message = message
await self.display_current_event(message)  # Updates same message
```

#### **2. Super Fast Transitions**
```python
# Before: 1.0+ second delays
await asyncio.sleep(3.0)

# After: Lightning fast
await asyncio.sleep(0.3)  # Super fast transition
await asyncio.sleep(0.8)  # Quick choice result
```

#### **3. Automatic Chapter Completion**
```python
async def complete_story_session(self, message=None):
    # Complete the current mission
    success, completion_message = await StoryCampaign.complete_mission(self.player_id, self.mission_id)
    
    # Check for next mission
    next_mission = await self.get_next_available_mission()
    
    if next_mission:
        # Show continue button
        view = StoryContinueView(self.ctx, self.player_id, next_mission)
```

#### **4. Continue Button System**
```python
class StoryContinueView(discord.ui.View):
    @discord.ui.button(label="📚 Continue Story", style=discord.ButtonStyle.primary)
    async def continue_story(self, interaction, button):
        # Start next mission in same UI
        story_session = InteractiveStorySession(...)
        await story_session.start_story_session(interaction.message)
