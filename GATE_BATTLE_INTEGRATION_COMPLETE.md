damage = random.randint(max(1, base_damage - 5), base_damage + 10)

# Skill damage (copied exactly)  
base_damage = max(1, int((self.player_stats['atk'] * (skill.damage / 100)) - self.enemy.get('defense', 0)))
damage = random.randint(max(1, base_damage - 3), base_damage + 8)

# Enemy damage (copied exactly)
base_damage = max(1, self.enemy.get('attack', 10) - self.player_stats['def'])
balanced_damage = max(1, int(base_damage * 0.7))  # 30% reduction
