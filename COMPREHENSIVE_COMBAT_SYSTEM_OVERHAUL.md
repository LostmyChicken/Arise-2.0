# Comprehensive Combat System Overhaul

## ✅ **MAJOR FEATURES IMPLEMENTED**

### **1. Precision/Accuracy & Dodge/Evasion System** ✅
Complete hit chance mechanics based on precision vs evasion stats.

#### **Hit Chance Formula:**
```
Base Hit Chance: 85%
Precision Modifier: ±0.5% per precision difference
Final Range: 10% - 95% hit chance
```

#### **Combat Mechanics:**
- **Player Precision** vs **Enemy Evasion** determines hit chance
- **AI Evasion** = Defense ÷ 10 (minimum 5)
- **PvP Evasion** = Opponent's precision stat
- **Visual Feedback** shows hit chance and miss reasons

#### **Miss Reasons:**
- "Enemy too agile!" (precision diff < -20)
- "Enemy dodged!" (precision diff < -10)  
- "Attack missed!" (precision diff < 0)
- "Bad luck!" (random miss)

### **2. Enhanced Skill Learning System** ✅
Players can now see detailed skill information and choose which skills to learn.

#### **Skill Preview Features:**
- **Detailed Effects**: Shows what each skill actually does
- **Damage Information**: Clear damage percentages and MP costs
- **Effect Descriptions**: Heal, buff, life steal, area damage, etc.
- **Selection Dropdown**: Choose specific skills to learn
- **Cost Display**: Shows skill point costs with affordability

#### **Learning Flow:**
```
1. sl skilltree → Choose tree → Learn Skills
2. See all available skills with full details
3. Select specific skill from dropdown
4. Confirm learning with detailed preview
5. Success message with remaining points
```

### **3. Comprehensive Skill Effects System** ✅
All buff, heal, and special effects now work properly in combat.

#### **Working Effects:**
- **💚 Healing**: Restores HP based on skill power
- **🩸 Life Steal**: Heals attacker for % of damage dealt
- **⬆️ Attack Buffs**: Increases attack power for 3 turns
- **⬇️ Defense Debuffs**: Reduces enemy defense for 2 turns
- **🎯 Crit Boost**: Increases critical hit chance
- **🛡️ Shield**: Absorbs incoming damage
- **😵 Stun**: Disables enemy for 1 turn
- **💥 Area Damage**: Affects multiple targets

#### **Effect Calculations:**
```python
# Healing: Half of skill damage as heal
heal_amount = base_attack * (skill_damage / 200)

# Life Steal: Up to 50% of damage dealt
life_steal_percent = min(50, skill_damage // 4)

# Buffs: Based on skill type
Ultimate: 20% stat boost
QTE: 15% stat boost  
Basic: 10% stat boost
```

### **4. Combat Stats Verification** ✅
All combat statistics are properly calculated and applied.

#### **Verified Systems:**
- **Precision Scaling**: 5.458 scaling factor with 5% per level
- **Damage Formula**: `attack * skill_multiplier * defense_reduction`
- **Defense Formula**: `100 / (100 + defense)`
- **Hit Chance**: `precision vs evasion with 85% base`
- **Stat Scaling**: Consistent across all systems

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Precision System**
```python
def calculate_hit_chance(attacker_precision, defender_evasion):
    base_hit_chance = 85.0
    precision_diff = attacker_precision - defender_evasion
    precision_modifier = max(-25.0, min(25.0, precision_diff * 0.5))
    final_hit_chance = max(10.0, min(95.0, base_hit_chance + precision_modifier))
    
    roll = random.uniform(0, 100)
    hit = roll <= final_hit_chance
```

### **Skill Effects Processing**
```python
def calculate_skill_effects(skill, base_attack, hit):
    effects_result = {
        "heal_amount": 0,
        "life_steal_amount": 0, 
        "buff_effects": [],
        "special_effects": []
    }
    
    for effect in skill.effects:
        if effect == EffectType.HEAL:
            heal_amount = max(10, round(base_attack * (skill.damage / 200.0)))
            effects_result["heal_amount"] = heal_amount
```

### **Combat Integration**
```python
# Apply skill effects in combat
if "effects" in damage_result:
    effects = damage_result["effects"]
    
    # Healing
    if effects["heal_amount"] > 0:
        self.p_hp = min(self.p_mhp, self.p_hp + effects["heal_amount"])
    
    # Life steal
    if effects["life_steal_amount"] > 0:
        life_steal_heal = round(damage * effects["life_steal_amount"] / 100)
        self.p_hp = min(self.p_mhp, self.p_hp + life_steal_heal)
```
