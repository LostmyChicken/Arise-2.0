# Stat Reset Achievement Bonus Fix

## ✅ **ISSUE RESOLVED**

### **Problem Identified** 🐛
The `sl rs` (stat reset) command was only returning base stat points (level × 10) and **not accounting for achievement bonuses** that players earned. This meant players were losing stat points they rightfully earned through achievements.

### **Achievements That Give Stat Points** 📊
Based on the achievement system, these achievements provide stat point bonuses:

#### **Progression Achievements:**
- **Rising Hunter** (Level 25): +10 stat points
- **Veteran Hunter** (Level 50): +25 stat points  
- **Elite Hunter** (Level 100): +50 stat points

#### **Combat Achievements:**
- **Battle Tested** (100 battles won): +15 stat points
- **War Machine** (1000 battles won): +30 stat points

#### **Collection Achievements:**
- **Hoarder** (100 different items): +20 stat points
- **Master Collector** (250 different items): +40 stat points
- **Shadow Monarch** (50 shadows collected): +100 stat points

#### **Special Achievements:**
- **Lucky Hunter** (10 rare drops in a row): +200 stat points
- **Speed Demon** (30-day daily streak): +75 stat points

**Total Possible Achievement Bonus**: Up to **565 stat points**

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **New Methods Added to Player Class:**
```python
async def calculate_total_stat_points_with_achievements(self):
    """Calculate total stat points including achievement bonuses"""
    base_points = self.level * 10
    achievement_bonus = await self.get_achievement_stat_points()
    return base_points + achievement_bonus

async def get_achievement_stat_points(self):
    """Get total stat points earned from achievements"""
    total_bonus = 0
    
    for achievement_id, achievement_data in self.achievements.items():
        if achievement_data.get('unlocked', False):
            if achievement_id in AchievementSystem.ACHIEVEMENTS:
                achievement = AchievementSystem.ACHIEVEMENTS[achievement_id]
                if 'stat_points' in achievement.rewards:
                    total_bonus += achievement.rewards['stat_points']
    
    return total_bonus
```

### **Updated Stat Reset Logic:**
```python
# Before: Only base points
fresh_player.statPoints = fresh_player.level * 10

# After: Base + achievement bonuses
total_stat_points = await fresh_player.calculate_total_stat_points_with_achievements()
fresh_player.statPoints = total_stat_points
```
