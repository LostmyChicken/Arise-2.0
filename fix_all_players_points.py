CRITICAL FIX SCRIPT: Reset all players' stat and skill points to correct values

This script fixes the major issue where:
- Stat points should be 10 per level (for upgrading base stats)
- Skill points should be 5 per level (for skill tree progression)

The previous system was incorrectly giving:
- 5 stat points per level (should be 10)
- 2 skill points per level + bonus (should be 5)
