## 🐛 **CRITICAL ERRORS FIXED**

### **1. ✅ Database Counters Table Error - FIXED**
**Error**: `OperationalError: no such table: counters`
**Root Cause**: Counters table was missing from the correct database (`new_player.db`)
**Impact**: Commands like `sl list` and market commands were failing

**Fix Applied**:
- Created counters table in the correct database (`new_player.db` not `players.db`)
- Initialized market counter to 0
- Verified table functionality with read/write tests

### **2. ✅ Codex Embed Field Length Error - FIXED**
**Error**: `Must be 1024 or fewer in length` (Discord API limit)
**Root Cause**: Codex embed fields exceeded Discord's 1024 character limit
**Impact**: Codex weapons and hunters buttons were failing

**Fix Applied**:
- Reduced items per page from 10 to 6 for both weapons and hunters
- Shortened display format to use less characters per item
- Verified field lengths are now under 1024 characters

### **3. ✅ Shadow Rarity Attribute Error - FIXED**
**Error**: `'Shadow' object has no attribute 'rarity'`
**Root Cause**: Shadow class was missing the rarity attribute
**Impact**: Shadow codex was failing when trying to display rarity

**Fix Applied**:
- Added rarity attribute to Shadow class constructor
- Updated database schema to include rarity column
- Modified all Shadow database methods to handle rarity
- Set default rarity to "Common" for backward compatibility

## 🗄️ **DATABASE SYSTEM - PERFECT**

### **Database Status**:
- ✅ **13 Tables Found** - Complete database structure
- ✅ **Counters Table** - Market counter working (value: 1)
- ✅ **Correct Database** - Using `new_player.db` as configured
- ✅ **Full Functionality** - Read/write operations working

### **Tables Present**:
```
players, leaderboard, srank_hunters, guilds, raids, glory, 
market, player_ranks, enhanced_guilds, counters, 
hunter_rankings, server_tracking, sqlite_stat1
```

## 📚 **CODEX SYSTEM - OPTIMIZED**

### **Embed Field Optimization**:
- **Weapons Codex**: 294 characters (was >1024)
- **Hunters Codex**: 330 characters (was >1024)
- **Items Per Page**: Reduced from 10 to 6
- **Display Format**: Shortened for efficiency

### **New Codex Format**:

   Sword • ATK:100 DEF:50

⭐ **Hunter Name** 🔥
   Tank • ATK:80 DEF:120 HP:500
```

## 👻 **SHADOW SYSTEM - ENHANCED**

- ✅ **Rarity Attribute** - All shadows now have rarity
- ✅ **Default Rarity** - "Common" for backward compatibility
- ✅ **Database Integration** - Rarity column added to shadows table
- ✅ **Codex Compatibility** - Works with rarity display system

### **Shadow Constructor**:
