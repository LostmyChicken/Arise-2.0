### **⚠️ RuntimeWarning Fixed:**

#### **✅ Problem: Unawaited Coroutine**
- **Error**: `RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'BattleSkillIntegration.update_skill_charges' was never awaited`
- **Root Cause**: Async method called without `await` keyword
- **Files Affected**: `commands/Fight.py`, `structure/pvp_system.py`

#### **✅ Solution: Added Missing Await Keywords**
```python
# BEFORE (Causing RuntimeWarning):
self.skill_charges = BattleSkillIntegration.update_skill_charges(self.skill_charges, self.p_skills or {})

# AFTER (Fixed):
self.skill_charges = await BattleSkillIntegration.update_skill_charges(self.skill_charges, self.p_skills or {})
```

#### **✅ Fixed Locations:**
- **commands/Fight.py:225** - Player vs AI battles
- **structure/pvp_system.py:357** - Player 1 skill charges
- **structure/pvp_system.py:359** - Player 2 skill charges
