# 📚 Help System Complete Fix

## ✅ **HELP COMMAND FULLY UPDATED**

### **🔍 Problem Identified:**
- **Wrong help command** was being updated (commands/help.py instead of main.py)
- **HelpCog in main.py** was overriding the commands/help.py version
- **Old categories** and command display format still showing
- **Missing dual prefix support** in the active help command

### **✅ Root Cause:**
The bot loads **TWO** help commands:
1. **HelpCog in main.py** (loaded first at line 471)
2. **Help class in commands/help.py** (loaded later, but overridden)

The **HelpCog in main.py** was the active one, so changes to commands/help.py had no effect.

# OLD (Basic categories):

        else:
            params.append(f"[{param_name}]")  # Optional

param_str = " ".join(params)

```

#### **✅ Enhanced Description System:**
```python
# Use detailed description if available
if command.name in detailed_usage:
