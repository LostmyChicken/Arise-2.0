## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Cooldown Tracking**
```python
# Individual cooldowns per player
self.skill_cooldowns = {
    "devastating_blow": 2,  # 2 turns remaining
    "meteor": 1,           # 1 turn remaining
    # Skills not in dict are ready to use
}

# Cooldown application
if skill.skill_type.value == "Ultimate":
    self.skill_cooldowns[skill_id] = 3  # 3-turn cooldown
```

### **Skill Status Display**
```python
# Status indicators in skill selection
if is_on_cooldown:
    status = f"🕒{cooldown_remaining}"
elif not can_use_mp:
    status = "❌"
else:
    status = "✅"

# Enhanced descriptions
description = f"Lvl {skill.level} | {status} {skill.damage}% DMG | {skill.mp_cost} MP"
if is_on_cooldown:
    description += f" | Cooldown: {cooldown_remaining} turns"
```

### **PvP Request System**
```python
class PvPFightRequest:
    def __init__(self, challenger_id, target_id, bot):
        self.challenger_id = challenger_id
        self.target_id = target_id
        self.accepted = False
        self.expired = False

class PvPFightRequestView(discord.ui.View):
    # 60-second timeout for accept/reject
    # Only target player can interact
    # Proper error handling and cleanup
```

### **Turn-Based Combat**
```python
class PvPFightHandler:
    def __init__(self, bot, player1_id, player2_id):
        self.current_turn = player1_id  # Player 1 goes first
        self.p1_skill_cooldowns = {}
        self.p2_skill_cooldowns = {}
        
    async def handle_player_action(self, interaction):
        # Validate turn ownership
        # Update cooldowns
        # Process action
        # Switch turns
        # Check victory conditions
```
