### **🔧 Technical Fixes:**

#### **✅ Emoji Display Fixed:**
```python
# Before (showing :gold: and ❔):
f"{getEmoji('gold')} {bank.get('gold', 0):,}"

# After (proper fallback emojis):
gold_emoji = getEmoji('gold') if getEmoji('gold') != "❔" else "🪙"
diamond_emoji = getEmoji('diamond') if getEmoji('diamond') != "❔" else "💎"
crystals_emoji = getEmoji('crystals') if getEmoji('crystals') != "❔" else "💠"

f"{gold_emoji} {bank.get('gold', 0):,}"
```

#### **✅ Error Handling Enhanced:**
```python
# User fetching with fallback
try:
    user = await self.ctx.bot.fetch_user(member["id"])
    user_name = f"{user.mention} ({user.display_name})"
except:
    user_name = f"<@{member['id']}>"
```

#### **✅ Navigation Flow:**
```python
async def create_embed(self):
    """Create embed based on current mode"""
    if self.current_mode == "overview":
        return await self.create_overview_embed()
    elif self.current_mode == "browse":
        return await self.create_browse_embed()
    elif self.current_mode == "manage":
        return await self.create_manage_embed()
    elif self.current_mode == "members":
        return await self.create_members_embed()      # ✅ Fixed
    elif self.current_mode == "applications":
        return await self.create_applications_embed() # ✅ Fixed
    elif self.current_mode == "bank":
        return await self.create_bank_embed()         # ✅ Fixed
    elif self.current_mode == "settings":
        return await self.create_settings_embed()     # ✅ Fixed
    elif self.current_mode == "info":
        return await self.create_info_embed()         # ✅ Added
    else:
        return await self.create_overview_embed()
```
