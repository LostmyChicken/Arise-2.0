## 🔧 **Technical Improvements**

### **Fixed Initialization**
```python
# Before: Async task in __init__ (unreliable)
def __init__(self, bot, user_id, tree_type):
    super().__init__(timeout=300)
    asyncio.create_task(self.add_skill_select())  # ❌ Unreliable

# After: Proper async setup
def __init__(self, bot, user_id, tree_type):
    super().__init__(timeout=300)
    # Initialize synchronously

async def setup_view(self):
    await self.add_skill_select()  # ✅ Reliable
    return self
```

### **Enhanced Dropdown Options**
```python
# Enhanced visual display with damage preview
damage_info = f"DMG: {current_damage} → {new_damage}"

options.append(discord.SelectOption(
    label=f"{skill.name} (Lv.{current_level} → {current_level + 1})",
    description=f"Cost: {upgrade_cost} SP {can_afford} | {damage_info}",
    value=skill_id,
    emoji="⬆️" if can_afford else "🔒"
))
```

### **Dynamic Button Management**
```python
def add_control_buttons(self):
    # Dynamically add buttons with proper callbacks
    upgrade_btn = discord.ui.Button(
        label="🚀 Upgrade Selected Skill",
        style=discord.ButtonStyle.success,
        row=1
    )
    upgrade_btn.callback = self.confirm_upgrade
