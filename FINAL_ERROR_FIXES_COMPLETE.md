## 🐛 **CRITICAL ERRORS FIXED**

### **1. ✅ Story Reward Items Error - FIXED**
**Error**: `'list' object has no attribute 'items'`
**Root Cause**: Code was calling `.items()` on `reward.items` (a list) as if it were a dict
**Impact**: Story completion crashed when trying to display item rewards

**Before (Broken)**:
```python
# reward.items is a List[str], not a dict!
for item_id, quantity in reward.items.items():  # ❌ .items() doesn't exist on list
    reward_text.append(f"🎁 **{quantity}x** {item_id}")
```

**After (Fixed)**:
```python
# Correctly handle reward.items as a list
for item_id in reward.items:  # ✅ Iterate over list directly
    reward_text.append(f"🎁 **{item_id}**")
```

### **2. ✅ Limit Break Item Data Error - FIXED**
**Error**: `'int' object does not support item assignment`
**Root Cause**: `item_data` was still being treated as int despite earlier conversion attempts
**Impact**: Limit break failed when trying to increase tier, wasting player cubes

**Before (Broken)**:
```python
# item_data could still be int at this point
item_data['tier'] = tier + 1  # ❌ Fails if item_data is int
```

**After (Fixed)**:
```python
# Ensure item_data is dict and update inventory
if not isinstance(item_data, dict):
    item_data = {'level': current_level, 'tier': tier}

item_data['tier'] = tier + 1  # ✅ Always works now
inventory[self.item_id] = item_data  # ✅ Ensure inventory is updated
```
